        Welcome to <strong>SDSM</strong> ("App," "we," "us," or "our"), a software application for

            comply with RocketWerkz and Steam terms.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h2>4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stationeers Compliance</strong>: The App is a third-party tool and does not include

            Stationeers dedicated server files (e.g., via SteamCMD) and complying with all RocketWerkz and Steam
            terms. We are not affiliated with RocketWerkz or Valve Corporation.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware and Setup</strong>: You provide all necessary hardware, software, internet access,

            quotas if applicable (e.g., API calls).</li>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the <em>compiled binaries</em> we
            distribute (this restriction does not limit your rights under the MIT License for the source code).
        </li>
        <li>Use the App to host illegal content, violate copyrights (including Stationeers assets), or engage in
            cheating, hacking, or DDoS attacks.</li>

            violate their terms.</li>
        <li>Distribute official binaries via unauthorized channels (e.g., torrent sites). Distributing your own
            builds from source under MIT is permitted.</li>
        <li>Use bots, cheats, or exploits in conjunction with Stationeers servers managed by the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The App, including its compiled form, user interface, documentation, and branding, is owned by us or our

    <h2>7. Updates and Availability</h2>
    <p>
        We may release updates for bug fixes, security, or new features. Updates may be automatic. We do not

    <h2>8. User Content and Data</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>No Hosting or Telemetry:</strong> SDSM is a self-hosted/local application. We do not operate a
        hosted service for SDSM, and we do not collect, receive, or transmit your configuration files, logs,
        player data, or other content. All data processed by SDSM remains on systems you control unless you
        explicitly transfer it elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        The App may initiate network requests you configure or trigger (e.g., SteamCMD, game server APIs, or
        downloading updates from third parties). Those interactions are between you and those third parties and
        are subject to their terms and privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p>
        You retain ownership and responsibility for your content. We do not provide cloud storage or data
        processing services for your content.

    <p>
        <strong>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND</strong>, express or implied,
        including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
        non-infringement.

    <p>
        WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR COMPATIBLE WITH ALL STATIONEERS UPDATES.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE</strong> for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
        punitive damages (including loss of data, profits, or server downtime), even if advised of the
        possibility. Our total liability shall not exceed <strong>$100 USD</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from your use of the App, including
        violations of RocketWerkz or third-party rights.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for violation of these Terms. Upon termination, your
        license ends immediately. You must delete the App and cease all use.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>the United States and the State selected by the
            project maintainer</strong>, without regard to conflict of laws principles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts designated by the project
        maintainer. You agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
