            <strong>Effective Date: November 5, 2025</strong><br>
            SDSM runs locally on machines you control. We do not operate a hosted service for SDSM, and we do not collect or receive your data.
        </div>

        <h3 class="mt-6">What We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <p>SDSM is designed with privacy as a core feature. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
            <li>No telemetry, analytics, or usage tracking is sent to us.</li>
            <li>No collection of your configuration files, player data, or server logs.</li>
            <li>No outbound data transfer to any servers operated by the SDSM developers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-6">Local-Only Operation</h3>
        <p>
            All data processed by SDSM remains on your system unless you explicitly configure integrations or manually copy it elsewhere. Any network requests initiated by SDSM (for example, downloading game files via SteamCMD or checking for updates) are made directly from your machine to the respective third-party services.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-6">Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>
            If you use third-party tools or services in conjunction with SDSM (e.g., Steam, RocketWerkz APIs), your usage is governed by their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the data practices of third parties.
